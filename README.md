## Overview

The Visual Question Answering (VQA) System is an AI-powered application that answers natural language questions about the content of images. The project combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to interpret and respond to user queries about visual content.

```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- Conda or virtual environment tool

## Setup

### 1. Create and Activate a Conda Environment

```bash
conda create --name vqa_env python=3.9
conda activate vqa_env
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install packages individually:

```bash
pip install torch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.1 transformers==4.23.1 streamlit==1.12.1 Pillow==9.3.0
```

## Training the Model

1. Prepare your dataset with images, questions, and answers.
2. Update the `train.py` script with your dataset paths and parameters.
3. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

The trained model will be saved as `vqa_model.pth`.

## Running the Application

Start the Streamlit app to interact with the VQA system:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Upload an image and enter a question to get an answer from the VQA system.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Select an image file (JPG, JPEG, PNG) to be analyzed.
2. **Ask a Question**: Type your question about the uploaded image.
3. **Get Answer**: The system will process the image and question, and display the answer.

## Future Improvements

- Implement scene graph generation for more complex question answering.
- Add explainability features to show which image regions influenced the answer.
- Extend the system to handle more diverse datasets and domains.
